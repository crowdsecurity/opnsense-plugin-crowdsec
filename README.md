Beware
------

 * The code in this repository has been merged in [https://github.com/opnsense/plugins](https://github.com/opnsense/plugins)
and new releases are done through the OPNsense channels.

 * The documentation is available at [docs.crowdsec.net](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/next/getting_started/install_crowdsec_opnsense).

 * Don't expect many features on the web interface, but feel free to give us a sense
   of your priorities. The command line should work the same as under Linux.

 * The exact same application under Linux and FreeBSD can have logs in
   different location and format. This means that supporting OPNsense plugins
   may require modifying the existing parsers or writing new ones. We did that
   for SSH and the web interface, let us know what else you want us to protect
   on your firewall.

 * For the changelog, see [pkg-descr](pkg-descr)
